## What skills will I need?

If you're a developer building a project with Prismic and Gatsby, we recommend that you already have a basic knowledge of React, CSS, and Gatsby.

If a developer sets up Prismic for you, you won't need any technical knowledge — anyone can use Prismic.

## Gatsby plugins and Prismic

Gatsby is a framework that offers a wide variety of plugins to customize and extend your application capabilities. Prismic has the following integration plugins:

- `[gatsby-source-prismic](./technical-reference-gatsby-source-prismic-v5.md)`: This source plugin helps you to pull data from Prismic.
- `[gatsby-plugin-prismic-previews](./technical-reference-gatsby-plugin-prismic-previews-v5.md)`: This plugin works together with the source plugin to integrate [Prismic Previews](./06-preview-drafts.md) into a Gatsby site.
